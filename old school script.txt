Real Estate Query Engine



 

                   

is a virtual rubicon of information,



 

                   

putting the lawyer himself

at the controls.



 

                   

Listen, I'm going to take off, okay?

I'm gonna try and catch the  :   back.



 

                   

You're leaving the seminar now?

It's not even intermission.



 

                   

- I don't think you can do that.

- No, it's fine. Just cover for me, okay?



 

                   

- Get it all.

- I guess.



 

                   

- Listen, could we have your badge?

- Yeah.



  

                   

It's worth two free drinks

at the Meet and Greet.



  

                   

Hello.



  

                   

I'm going to the airport.

I'm kind of in a hurry, too.



  

                   

Sir, your seat belt

seems to be broken.



  

                   

What do you recommend I do?



  

                   

I recommend you stop being such a faggot.



  

                   

You're in the back seat.



  

                   

Jesus.



  

                   

See?

Hello?



  

                   

Hey, boy.



  

                   

Good boy, Orson.

Where's Mommy?



  

                   

Honey?



  

                   

Heidi?



  

                   

[woman moaning]



  

                   

Heidi?



  

                   

[moanlng]



  

                   

[moanlng contlnues]



  

                   

Mitch!



  

                   

What are you doing home?

You totally scared me!



  

                   

I scared you?

Because for a second, I thought...



  

                   

I don't even want to say it.



  

                   

[moaning]



  

                   

Wow.



  

                   

That's, like, pretty hard-core.



  

                   

Yeah, I know.



  

                   

No, I'm notjudging.

Don't be embarrassed.



  

                   

This is a major turn-on.

Let's go with this.



  

                   

- Is this what you do when I'm gone?

- Mitch, wait.



  

                   

No, I mean, I do it myself every once

in a while, but to magazines.



  

                   

Okay, Mitch, we need to talk.



  

                   

- Hello!

- Aah!



  

                   

[couple screaming]



  

                   

[barking]



  

                   

Be honest.



  

                   

Please tell me this is the first time

this has happened.



  

                   

Well, do you want me to be honest, or you

want me to tell you this is the first time?



  

                   

- Jesus, what is wrong with you?

- Nothing is wrong with me!



  

                   

I've tried to tell you about this.



  

                   

What? When?



  

                   

- All the time!

- Like when?



  

                   

- Like, when we're in bed and stuff.

- In bed?



  

                   

I thought you were just talking dirty.



  

                   

I was, but I was being serious.



  

                   

You've said some really sick stuff.



  

                   

You have to admit it,



  

                   

we haven't exactly been living the most

exciting lives in the world.



  

                   

This is a totally different kind

of satisfaction for me.



  

                   

It's purely sexual.



  

                   

Ooh!



  

                   

[crying]

I'm really sorry.



  

                   

[doorbell rlngs]



  

                   

Hello.



  

                   

Yeah?



  

                   

I'm here for the gang bang.



  

                   

[sighs]



  

                   

[church bell rlngs]

[plpe organ playlng]



  

                   

You look a little pale, Mitch.

You need to breathe.



  

                   

Let a little blood up in your face there,

will ya?



  

                   

- I don't want to breathe.

- You should be proud of yourself.



  

                   

Do you have any idea how hard it is to land

a girl as sexually enlightened as Heidi is?



  

                   

A girl like that comes around, what,

once every hundred years?



  

                   

I wasn't looking for a girl like that.



  

                   

Oolumbus wasn't looking for America,

but that seemed to work out for everybody.



  

                   

You're here.

You know what I mean?



  

                   

Hey, I just want to thank you

one last time for being here.



  

                   

It's the best day ever.



  

                   

Don't even start with me, Franklin, okay?

You need to walk away from this ASAP.



  

                   

- What?

- You need to get out, Frankie.



  

                   

[weddlng march plays]



  

                   

This is it. It's now or never. You need

to get out of here while you're still single.



  

                   

- I'm not single.

- She's    yards away, you're single now.



  

                   

Oome on, Marissa's the best thing

that's ever happened to me.



  

                   

Why don't you give that six months.

You don't think that'll change?



  

                   

I got a wife, kids.



  

                   

Do I seem like a happy guy to you,

Frankie?



  

                   

There's my wife. See that?



  

                   

Always smiling? Hi, honey.

Judging, watching, "Look at the baby."



  

                   

She's coming down the aisle, Beanie.

Let it go.



  

                   

Let me be the first to say

congratulations to you then.



  

                   

You get one vagina for the rest of your life.

Real smart. Way to work it through.



  

                   

- [Mitch:] Don't listen to him.

- [Frank:] I need my inhaler.



  

                   

It takes a man to give away an angel.

You're a sweetheart.



  

                   

You look beautiful.



  

                   

Great.



  

                   

Dearly beloved,



  

                   

we are gathered here together



   

                   

to join Franklin and Marissa...



   

                   

Don't do it!



   

                   

[coughs loudly]



   

                   

My throat is dry.

I'm sorry.



   

                   

I'm a smoker.



   

                   

Okay.

Mitch Martin?



   

                   

Yeah.



   

                   

Nicole!



   

                   

My God!



   

                   

This is crazy!



   

                   

I can't believe it's you!



   

                   

God.



   

                   

- What are you doing here?

- I was invited.



   

                   

The last time that I had heard,

you had moved to...



   

                   

- What do you call it?

- Denver.



   

                   

The Sunshine State.



   

                   

Denver!



   

                   

Gorgeous!

Gorgeous!



   

                   

Oh, boy.



   

                   

Are you okay?



   

                   

No, I'm...



   

                   

Yeah, I just feel a little...



   

                   

fucked up.



   

                   

Yeah, Marissa told me about your

girlfriend. I'm very sorry.



   

                   

The thing about that one is,

is it's notjust that.



   

                   

It's a combination of things.



   

                   

We had a dog,

we had a great place,



   

                   

but all just...

[deflating noise]



   

                   

You know what?

I think you should have some of this.



   

                   

- What's in this one?

- Ooffee.



   

                   

[slurping]



   

                   

[laughing, then screams]

Ow! Oww! Jesus!



   

                   

- I am so sorry! Please, just...

- No, don't touch!



   

                   

- I can fix it. Just...

- Mitch, really.



   

                   

- No, Mitch!

- What are you doing to this poor girl?



   

                   

Mitch, stop it!

I got it.



   

                   

No. Inappropriate.

Stop it right now.



   

                   

- Sweetie, there's a bathroom over here.

- Thank you.



   

                   

Mitch, honey? Hon?



   

                   

Why don't you go get some air, okay?

Walk it off.



   

                   

No, wait a second.



   

                   

Yeah?



   

                   

- Put in a good word for me.

- Yeah, okay.

You're the lady.



   

                   

[applause, clinking glasses]



   

                   

Can't hear youl



   

                   

Excuse me.



   

                   

I'd like to say I'm really glad

and proud to be here tonight.



   

                   

I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.

I haven't seen him in eight years.



   

                   

That's great.

Oongratulations.



   

                   

I love you, Dad!



   

                   

True love is hard to find.



   

                   

Sometimes you think you have true love,



   

                   

and then you catch the early flight

home from San Diego,



   

                   

and a couple of nude people

jump out of your bathroom blindfolded



   

                   

like a goddamn magic show,

ready to double-team your girlfriend...



   

                   

It stops right there

and it continues right here,



   

                   

because I think what Mitch is trying to say

is that true love is blind.



   

                   

Let's raise our glasses,

whatever we got in front of us.



   

                   

Salute. Health and happiness.



   

                   

Oheers, everybody.



   

                   

I love you so much, Frankie.

I love you.



   

                   

I'm not a talker.



   

                   

I love you.

Oongratulations.



   

                   

I thought you said near campus.

This is practically on-campus. It's sick.



   

                   

- This is great.

- How did you land this place?



   

                   

I don't know, it was pretty easy, actually.



   

                   

A professor lived here for, like,

   years, and then he died.



   

                   

That's awesome!



   

                   

That's awesome.



   

                   

A little housewarming.



   

                   

To new beginnings.



   

                   

Thanks.



   

                   

Actually, I gave this to you

for your wedding.



   

                   

This model?



   

                   

No, this exact one.



   

                   

I'm sorry.



   

                   

I'm embarrassed.

I'm sorry.



   

                   

It's okay.



   

                   

I hope you like it.



   

                   

I love it.

Thank you.



   

                   

This place is unbelievable.



   

                   

- You like it?

- How could you still be depressed?



   

                   

This is the probably the best thing

that's ever happened to us.



   

                   

- Us?

- Yeah, us.



   

                   

Do not get selfish on me here, okay?

Now stay with me.



   

                   

You put a bar in over there, right?



   

                   

Oouple La-Z-Boys to fill it out, a smarter

couch. You could put a hot tub anywhere.



   

                   

Max, can you earmuff it for me?



   

                   

We're gonna get so much ass here,

it's gonna be sick.



   

                   

I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.



   

                   

That sounds like a lot of fun, but



   

                   

I need a little time to get

my life back together.



   

                   

We need to throw a big

kick-ass party to start things off.



   

                   

Absolutely.

Break it in a little, meet the neighbors.



   

                   

Oome on, Mitch.

You know what I'm talking about.



   

                   

Break it in.



   

                   

The real estate guy was really

adamant about not having...



   

                   

I don't think you realize what

a huge opportunity this is for you.



   

                   

Girls love a guy who's in your

particular situation.



   

                   

What situation?



   

                   

Mitch, you're on the rebound.



   

                   

You're like an injured fawn

nursed back to health,

into the wilderness.



   

                   

[glass breaking]

Sorry.



   

                   

[baby crying]

Please be careful.



   

                   

- I'm sorry. You okay?

- Don't say sorry to me, say it to the baby.



   

                   

- You upset him.

- Sorry, baby.



   

                   

It's okay. It happens.



   

                   

We should go tropical with this thing.



   

                   

Like sand from wall to wall. I know a great

sand guy, we'll get it at price.



   

                   

Sand in here?



   

                   

Or foam, whatever.

Something in here.



   

                   

- You understand what I'm talking about?

- Absolutely.



   

                   

I'm good either way.

Just need to run it by Marissa.



   

                   

I'm messing with you guys!

It's a joke!



   

                   

[baby cries]



   

                   

It's not funny.

And now the baby is upset.



   

                   

[loud muslc]



   

                   

[englne revs]



   

                   

[muslc contlnues]



   

                   

[shouts:] Hey!



   

                   

Hey!



   

                   

Hey, honey!



   

                   

I brought you an iced tea!



   

                   

No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.



   

                   

Oan you turn that off for a second?



   

                   

[muslc stops]

[englne sputters]



   

                   

Wow. That's really loud.



   

                   

Yeah. Thanks.



   

                   

I took the restrictor plate off,

give the Red Dragon a little more juice.



   

                   

But let's keep that on the down low.

She's not exactly street legal.



   

                   

Hey, Mike!



   

                   

Right.



   

                   

- So, what's up?

- Nothing much.



   

                   

I was hoping we might get to those

thank you notes tomorrow night.



   

                   

Honey, I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.



   

                   

Oh, that's right.

I totally forgot.



   

                   

But I can skip it.



   

                   

Oh! No.



   

                   

Don't be silly.



   

                   

I mean, I wouldn't want you changing

your whole life just for me.



   

                   

I'll give Lara a call

and we'll plan a girls' night.



   

                   

- It'll be fun.

- Thanks.



   

                   

You're the best.



   

                   

Just as long as you promise to take it easy,

you know.



   

                   

- What do you mean?

- You know exactly what I mean.



   

                   

You've come a long way since Frank the

Tank, and we don't want him coming back.



   

                   

Honey, Frank the Tank

is not coming back, okay?



   

                   

That part of me is over.

It's water under the bridge.



   

                   

I promise.



   

                   

[crowd cheering]



   

                   

Nice, right?



   

                   

This is incredible.

How did you do this?



   

                   

With all the people here,

and the speakers.



   

                   

I thought we were having

a small get-together.



   

                   

It's one of many

small get-togethers.



   

                   

That's why you got the house, brother.



   

                   

You're having fun?



   

                   

- I'm having a great time.

- Good.



   

                   

What else have you got planned?

A student band or something?



   

                   

Yeah, that's it.



   

                   

I got a student alt rock band

coming on stage next.



   

                   

I own six Speaker Oities.



   

                   

I'm worth $ .  million,

that the government knows about.



   

                   

I got more electronics up there

than a damn KISS concert.



   

                   

You think I'd roll out that kind of red carpet

for a fuckin' marching band?



   

                   

Just make sure you can see the stage.



   

                   

Excuse me. Pardon me.



   

                   

I just want to get through this door,

if you don't mind.



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

This is the guy I was talking about.

This is his house.



   

                   

- What's up, man?

- No, that's my friend, Mitch.



   

                   

My friend Mitch, he owns the house.



   

                   

Anyway, come hit this right here.

You need to hit this.



   

                   

No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife

I wouldn't drink tonight.



   

                   

Besides, I've got a big day tomorrow.

But you guys have a great time.



   

                   

A big day? Doing what?



   

                   

Well, actually,

pretty nice little Saturday.



   

                   

We're going to Home Depot.



   

                   

Buy some wallpaper,

maybe get some flooring.



   

                   

Stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath

and Beyond, I don't know.



   

                   

I don't know if we'll have enough time.



   

                   

You know what? Give me that thing.

I'll do one.



   

                   

He gonna do one!

He gonna do one!



   

                   

That's a talented man right there.



   

                   

- That's what I'm talking about.

- Fill it up again!



   

                   

God, that's good.

It's so good!



   

                   

Once it hits your lips,

it's so good.



   

                   

Thank you very much, guys. This will be

happening at this house all year.



   

                   

So just get ready,

don't burn yourselves out tonight.



   

                   

I wanna thank you very much for coming to

the official Mitch Martin Freedom Festival.



   

                   

For those who don't know

who Mitch Martin is,



   

                   

he's the very successful,



   

                   

very disease-free gentleman

standing by the mini-bar.

This party is great.

Nice work.



   

                   

My friends put it on for me.



   

                   

They're kind of rereleasing me

out into the wild.



   

                   

What are you talking about?



   

                   

Nothing. Sorry.

I'm sorry.



   

                   

We're going streaking through the quad

and into the gymnasium.



   

                   

Oome on, everybody!



   

                   

Oome on, Snoop!

Bring your green hat. Let's go.



   

                   

Oome on, everybody, we're going!



   

                   

Here we go!



   

                   

Man, man.

Man, put the music back on.



   

                   

Let's get

the party back cracking up in here.



   

                   

[crowd cheers]



   

                   

Whoo! Oome on!

Oome on!



   

                   

Oh, tell her!



   

                   

Marissa, I totally forgot.



   

                   

I know it's a little belated, but we got you

the perfect wedding present!



   

                   

Oome on, you guys, I told you,

you don't have to get me anything.



   

                   

Our friend Ashley had this guy come over

and teach a blow job class.



   

                   

- It was incredible.

- A class?



   

                   

And he's really good,

so we had to book him way in advance.



   

                   

Why should I go to a class?



   

                   

Bernard should be the one going to class.

I swear, the man is orally challenged.



   

                   

- Wait a second, is that guy...

- [Frank whooplng]



   

                   

Oh, my God.



   

                   

That's disgusting!



   

                   

Why am I looking at that?



   

                   

Why are you slowing down?



   

                   

Just drive. Go.

[horns honking]



   

                   

Frank?



   

                   

No way.



   

                   

Frank!



   

                   

Hey, honey.



   

                   

What the hell are you doing?



   

                   

We're streaking. We're going up

through the quad to the gymnasium.



   

                   

Who's streaking?



   

                   

There's more coming.



   

                   

Frank, get in the car.



   

                   

- Everybody's doing it.

- Now!



   

                   

Okay.



   

                   

Whoa! Scooch over.



   

                   

Hey, ladies.



   

                   

Hey, Frank.

Looks like it's a little cold out there, huh?



   

                   

[girls giggling]



   

                   

Please, guys.



   

                   

Honey, do you think KFO is still open?



   

                   

[girls laughing]



   

                   

[lawn mower]



   

                   

[alarm buzzes]



   

                   

Oh, shit.



   

                   

Good morning.



   

                   

Now, that was a party.



   

                   

Since when are you so shy?



   

                   

No, I'm not.

I just...



   

                   

Did I snore last night?

Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.



   

                   

I don't remember.



   

                   

I don't think so.



   

                   

Listen, about last night.



   

                   

I just got out of a very serious

and traumatic relationship.



   

                   

I'm kind of in a weird place right now.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.



   

                   

Mitch, with an "M."



   

                   

Right. Look.



   

                   

Whatever. We were just having a little fun.

You have nothing to worry about.



   

                   

No.



   

                   

Yeah, you're right.

I'm okay with it.



   

                   

It's casual. I was just...



   

                   

I got to go to class, so...



   

                   

So, how do we do this? Shall I...



   

                   

You want to leave me your number?



   

                   

You don't even have to worry about it.



   

                   

See you around.



   

                   

Bye.

Shoot me straight.



   

                   

Really good.



   

                   

- You look great.

- Really?



   

                   

God, I went a little bit...



   

                   

Got crazy last night.



   

                   

Yeah, I still haven't heard from Frank.

I'm a little worried.



   

                   

Hello?

[cans clink]



   

                   

Oome on in. Jesus!



   

                   

Is this one of your guys here?



   

                   

- About three fire hazards over here.

- What are you doing, man?



   

                   

Oheese, is that you?



   

                   

Hello, Mitch, Bernard.

I see you guys haven't changed much.



   

                   

Who is this?



   

                   

Remember Oheese,

Rodney's kid brother?



   

                   

Actually, my name isn't Oheese anymore.

It's Gordon Pritchard.



   

                   

Oh, yeah!



   

                   

Oheese!



   

                   

Didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?



   

                   

I got out.



   

                   

Oool, man.

I'm glad you did.



   

                   

- You had a good time last night?

- Yeah.



   

                   

There might be some whippits

lying around if you want them.



   

                   

- No, thanks. I'm working.

- Working what?



   

                   

Oampus patrol?



   

                   

- Try again.

- You a Jehovah's Witness?



   

                   

- [Beanie and Gordon laugh]

- I'm the dean.



   

                   

Dean Pritchard. Yeah.



   

                   

And as of this morning,

this house has been rezoned.



   

                   

It is now exclusively

for campus use only.



   

                   

What are you talking about?



   

                   

You can'tjust do that. I've already paid

the first and last month's rent!



   

                   

Take a look at that.



   

                   

You have a week to vacate the premises,

and I thank you for your cooperation.
